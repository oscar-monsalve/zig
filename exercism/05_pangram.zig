// Your task is to figure out if a sentence is a pangram.
//
// A pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. It is case insensitive, so it doesn't
// matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g. k) or upper-case (e.g. K).
//
// The best known English pangram is:
// The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
//
// For this exercise, a sentence is a pangram if it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.
